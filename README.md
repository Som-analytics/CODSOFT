Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is part of my CodSoft Data Science Internship tasks.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

📁 Dataset Used
- Source: Titanic dataset (`Titanic-Dataset.csv`)
- Contains features such as:
- `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, etc.
- Target variable: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

✅ Workflow
1. Data cleaning and handling missing values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
4. Building a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluating the model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
6. Visualizing results

📊 Output
- Accuracy score printed in notebook
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Actual vs Predicted bar chart
- Pie chart for correct vs incorrect predictions
